# Simple Image Converter
## Description
This is an image converter I made for personal use.
It supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF and WEBP formats. 
## How to use
The easiest way is to just download the latest executable (windows and ubuntu-based os) in the release section and run it. 
You can also run the main.py-file directly using python, but then you'll need both the 'pillow' and the 'ttkbootstrap' library (you can get them with 'pip install ...' in the terminal).
